tree-lights
===========

Code for running the lights in the wooden tree on my daughters' bunk bed.

We've made an MDF model of a a couple of trees and some meadows and attached
them to my daughters' bunk beds. In the main tree I've embedded a string of
WS2811/WS2812 LEDs and a controlling arduino to drive them.
